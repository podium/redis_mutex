# CHANGELOG

## 1.1.0 (2024-10-01)

* Remove support for Elixir 1.13. Minimum is Elixir 1.14

## 1.0.0 (2024-02-12)

### Changed

**Breaking changes**
- `RedisMutex` no longer starts as its own application. Instead, it can re-use an existing Redis connection
  or be started in your application's supervision tree. Here is an example of starting it in an application's
  supervision tree:
```elixir
  @impl Application
  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = other_children() ++ [{RedisMutex, redis_url: System.get_env("REDIS_URL")}]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one, name: MyApp.Supervisor)
  end
```
  Please see the README for more details.
- `use RedisMutex` replaced in favor of calling `RedisMutex.with_lock/3` directly
- `with_lock` changed to take a function argument instead of a do block to perform
- `with_lock` changed to take a keyword list of options instead of optional `timeout` and `expiry` arguments
